# units.js

units.js is a Javascript library meant to format quantities that have units,
such as distances, weights, force, energy, powerâ€¦ It uses
[TwitterCldr](https://github.com/twitter/twitter-cldr-js]) to perform the
formatting of numbers in an i18n-safe fashion.

Just don't use it now, it's not ready yet.
